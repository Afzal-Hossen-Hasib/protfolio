            My Name Is Afzal Hossen Hasib. I am still a Student. But when I was
            in my first year of honors, I was working in an IT company. I used
            to work as a Marketing Executive in that company. I also worked as a
            team at the company.

          <h3 class="color">2019-2020| Merchant Acquisition Executive</h3>
          <p>
            After I quit my first job, I got a better job offer at bKash
            Distribution House. At this company I got a job as a Merchant
            Acquisition Executive. And I work there for quite some time. I also
            quit this job as my final exams started later.
